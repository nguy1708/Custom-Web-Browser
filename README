/* Custome Web Browser
* With the wrapper given, I was to create a custom
* web browser using C. This helped teach the concept of 
* threads, master processes, child processes,
* and kill signals. There was also some socket
* programing involved as I was to retrieve the 
* URL. 
*
* To start, type "make" into the terminal when in this 
* project's root. 
* Next, run "./browser"
* Once finished, "make clean" to clean up everything
